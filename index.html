			<h2>Subtheme: Zoning and Housing Supply</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Which municipalities in Metro Boston have the highest proportion of single-family-only zoning, and
					how does this correlate with local racial and income demographics?</li>
				<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The <i>Exclusionary by Design</i> report highlights how zoning has
					historically been used as a tool for economic and racial exclusion. One particularly striking
					example is Dedham's 1947 Master Plan, which explicitly recommended a 40,000 square foot minimum lot
					size "as a means of keeping up property values and attracting well-to-do newcomers." This statement
					underscores how zoning regulations have been intentionally designed to shape the socioeconomic
					composition of communities. It made me wonder whether municipalities with a higher percentage of
					single-family zoning today tend to have less racial diversity and higher income levels, and
					ultimately, which demographic group(s) benefit the most from these restrictive zoning policies.</p>
				<li>How do household types differ across municipalities in Metro Boston, and what might this reveal
					about unmet housing needs or gaps?</li>
				<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> I’ve noticed that different household types have different housing
					needs, yet zoning policies often take a one-size-fits-all approach, prioritizing traditional nuclear
					families over other living arrangements. This made me curious about how household compositions, such
					as family vs. nonfamily households, differ across
					Metro Boston municipalities and whether zoning policies align with actual housing demand. For
					example, if a town has a high percentage of single-person households but is mostly zoned for
					single-family homes, it might suggest a gap in housing options like apartments, duplexes, or
					accessory dwelling units (ADUs). The <i>Living Little</i> report highlights creative small-scale
					housing solutions that could help fill these gaps and I hope to identify where zoning reforms might
					be most needed to better accommodate the diverse ways people live today.</p>
				<li>Among MBTA Communities, which municipalities are positioned to benefit most from transit-oriented
					upzoning, and which could show signs of resistance?</li>
				<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The <i>MBTA Communities Act</i> was designed to promote transit-oriented
					development by requiring municipalities with MBTA service to allow multi-family housing near transit
					stations. I find this policy fascinating because it has the potential to increase housing supply in
					areas already connected to public transit, making housing more accessible and reducing car
					dependency. However, I’ve also heard about the controversy surrounding its implementation where some
					municipalities are embracing the changes, while others are pushing back due to concerns about
					density, neighborhood character, and local control. This made me curious about which MBTA
					communities are best positioned to benefit from transit-oriented upzoning and which might be
					resisting or showing signs of non-compliance.</p>

			<h2>Data Overview & Quality</h2>
			<h3>Data Overview</h3>
			<p>
				The dataset comprises zoning and census data for municipalities in Metro Boston. The primary independent
				variables are <code>muni_id</code>, which represents the
				municipal ID number, and <code>muni</code>, which indicates the municipality's name. All other columns
				represent
				dependent variables measuring various housing and demographic characteristics.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the key categorical variables is <code>is_housing</code>, which, as per the metadata, is always
				set to 1 since
				only housing zones are included in the dataset. This raises a consideration—if there are no areas where
				<code>is_housing == 0</code>, perhaps this column could have been excluded to reduce redundancy.
				Additionally,
				<code>only_single_family</code> is another categorical variable that determines whether a zoning area
				allows only
				single-family homes (1) or includes other types of housing (0).
			</p>
			<p>
				The variable <code>%_single_family</code> provides the percentage of residential land in a municipality
				that is
				exclusively zoned for single-family homes. This metric is crucial in understanding the distribution of
				housing types. Furthermore, <code>is_MBTA_community</code> indicates whether a municipality is
				classified as part of
				an MBTA community, which has implications for public transportation access.
			</p>
			<p>
				From the <i>2010 census data</i> aggregated by zoning area, the dataset includes total population
				(<code>pop</code>) and its
				breakdown by gender (<code>male, female</code>), age (<code>pop_u18, pop_18_64, pop_65o</code>), and
				race (<code>nhwhi, nhaa, nhna,
				nhas, nhpi, nhoth, nhmlt, lat</code>). Notably, these sub-attributes should sum to the total population.
				Similarly, family households (<code>fhh</code>) and nonfamily households (<code>nfhh</code>) are further
				divided into
				subcategories based on household size.
			</p>
			<p>
				For income, the dataset incorporates data from the <i>2014-2018 American Community Survey</i>, detailing
				household income distributions in various brackets, ranging from under $10,000 to $200,000 or more.
				Given that income data originates from census block groups rather than zoning areas, some discrepancies
				may exist where small zoning areas could lack corresponding income values.
			</p>
			<h3>Data Quality</h3>
			<p>
				A data quality observation is that for municipalities where <code>only_single_family == 0</code>,
				<code>%_single_family == 0</code>, and <code>pop == 0</code>, all subcategories of total population are
				also zero. This occurs in
				<b>Burlington</b>, <b>Chelsea</b>, <b>Somerville</b>, and <b>Everett</b>, meaning that census population
				data is not available for
				non-single-family housing zones in these municipalities. Conversely, in municipalities where
				<code>%_single_family != 0</code> but <code>pop == 0</code>, such as <b>Framingham</b>, <b>Lynn</b>,
				<b>Sharon</b>, <b>Belmont</b>, <b>Sudbury</b>, and <b>Waltham</b>,
				their respective duplicate rows contain the population breakdown, ensuring that this data is retained in
				the dataset.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite these gaps in population data, household income data remains available for all cases. This
				consistency in income reporting ensures that we can still analyze economic demographics even where
				population subcategories are missing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lastly, I encountered an initial challenge in understanding the structure of the dataset due to some
				municipalities having two rows—one for single-family zoning and another for other housing zoning. This
				structure required additional attention to avoid misinterpretations when analyzing trends.
			</p>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

			<figure>

				<figcaption>
					Let's begin exploring our first overall question. This bar chart illustrates the proportion of
					residential land in each Metro Boston municipality that is exclusively zoned for single-family
					homes, sorted from highest to lowest. Notably, <b>Wenham, Nahant, Hopkinton, Hanover, Duxbury,
						Dover, and Bolton</b> have <b>100%</b>
					of their
					residential land restricted to single-family zoning, while <b>Action, Gloucester, Revere, Wakefield,
						North Reading, and Essex</b> have
					significantly lower percentages, allowing for more diverse housing types. A striking data point is
					<b>Stow</b>, which has nearly no single-family zoning at all. Additionally, of the <b>59</b>
					municipalities
					shown, only
					<b>13</b> have less than <b>50%</b> of their residential land designated for single-family homes,
					highlighting how
					dominant this zoning type remains in the Metro Boston area.

					Note that the dataset revealed that some municipalities have two rows based on
					<code>only_single_family</code>, as some
					entries did not have <code>%_single_family == 100</code> or <code>%_single_family == 0</code>. To
					ensure accuracy and avoid
					duplication, we filtered the data to include only rows where <code>only_single_family = 1</code>,
					which also
					helped exclude municipalities that had no single-family zones.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/figure-2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Now that we have identified the municipalities with the highest proportion of single-family-only
					zoning, we can examine their racial composition. This bar chart visualizes the top 10 municipalities
					in Metro Boston with the highest percentage of single-family zoning, broken down by racial
					demographics. A clear pattern emerges: these municipalities have overwhelmingly high proportions of
					White residents, with non-White populations making up a small fraction of the total. While some
					towns, such as <b>Hopkinton</b>, exhibit slightly more diversity at around <b>30%</b>, all of the
					top 10
					municipalities remain over <b>50%</b> White. This aligns with historical patterns where restrictive
					zoning
					policies, such as single-family-only zoning, have contributed to racial homogeneity by limiting
					access to more affordable and diverse housing types. The stark contrast in racial demographics
					suggests that single-family zoning may continue to reinforce racial segregation, potentially
					restricting housing opportunities for racially diverse households.

				<figcaption>
					Next, we examine the income breakdown of these municipalities. This scatterplot illustrates the
					income distribution across the top 10 municipalities with the highest percentage of single-family
					zoning, with each point representing the number of households in a given income bracket. These
					municipalities have a significant concentration of households in higher income
					categories, particularly those earning above <b>$100,000</b>, with some municipalities showing a
					substantial number of households making over <b>$200,000</b>. In contrast, the number of households
					in
					lower income brackets, especially those earning under <b>$50,000</b>, is relatively sparse. This
					reinforces
					the idea that single-family zoning disproportionately benefits higher-income households, potentially
					creating economic barriers for lower-income families who may struggle with high property costs and
					limited housing options. This leads me to wonder whether gender plays a significant role in shaping
					the demographics of single-family zoning as well.
				</figcaption>

				<img src="figures/figure-4.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This bar chart displays the gender distribution in the top 10 municipalities with the highest
					percentage of single-family zoning. The distribution appears to be relatively balanced between male
					and female populations, with a slight majority of females in most municipalities. This suggests that
					gender does not play a significant role in shaping the demographic composition of areas with
					restrictive single-family zoning. Unlike race and income, where stark disparities were observed,
					gender distribution remains relatively consistent, indicating that zoning policies may not directly
					influence gender composition in the same way they impact racial and economic diversity. Since gender
					does not appear to be a major factor, it raises the question of whether age plays a more significant
					role in these municipalities.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/figure-5.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This bar chart examines the age distribution in the top 10 municipalities with the highest
					percentage of single-family zoning, categorizing populations into three groups: under <b>18</b>,
					working-age adults (<b>18-64</b>), and seniors (<b>65+</b>). We see that these
					municipalities have a
					substantial proportion of working-age adults, with a significant share of seniors, with the
					proportion of children under <b>18</b> trailing behind. The relatively high presence of
					working-age
					adults suggests that these areas remain home to active professionals, but the sizable senior
					population raises questions about whether an aging
					demographic contribute to restrictive zoning policies by limiting housing options for younger
					residents as the older cohorts grows older and older. After analyzing the complete
					demographic breakdown, it becomes evident that the group most benefiting from these restrictive
					zoning policies are <i>high-income, White, working-age adults with families</i>, reinforcing
					historical
					patterns of exclusion in these communities.

				<img src="figures/figure-6.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Next, we turn to our second question. This scatterplot visualizes the relationship between the
					percentage of family households and nonfamily households across Metro Boston municipalities. As
					expected, there is a strong inverse relationship: municipalities with a higher percentage of
					nonfamily households tend to have a lower proportion of family households, and vice versa. Towns
					like <b>Lynn</b> and <b>Manchester</b> have an overwhelming majority of family households, whereas
					places like
					<b>Essex</b> and <b>North Reading</b> show a more significant presence of nonfamily households. This
					variation in
					household composition suggests that a one-size-fits-all zoning approach may not align with actual
					housing needs. If municipalities with high percentages of nonfamily households are primarily zoned
					for single-family homes, this could indicate a shortage of smaller, more flexible housing options
					such as apartments, duplexes, or accessory dwelling units (ADUs). Addressing this mismatch through
					zoning reforms could help ensure that housing supply better reflects the diverse ways people live
					today. Taking this a step further, I’m curious to explore municipalities with a high percentage of
					single-person households yet a predominance of single-family zoning. This could reveal even deeper
					misalignments between housing needs and availability.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/figure-7.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This scatterplot examines the relationship between the prevalence of single-person nonfamily
					households and the percentage of single-family zoning across Metro Boston municipalities. The
					general
					trend suggests that municipalities with a high proportion of single-family zoning tend to have fewer
					single-person households, while those with more diverse housing options appear to accommodate more
					single-person nonfamily households. For instance, towns like <b>Salem</b> and <b>Wellesley</b>,
					which
					have a higher number of single-person households, tend to have lower single-family zoning
					percentages. In contrast, municipalities such as <b>Bolton</b> and <b>Dover</b>, which are dominated
					by
					single-family zoning, have far fewer single-person households. Note, we should be wary of
					<b>Sudbury</b> which has both a high proportion of single-family zoning and higher number of
					single-person households. This disparity highlights a potential
					misalignment between zoning policies and housing needs, particularly for individuals who may prefer
					smaller, more affordable housing options. The visualization reinforces the importance of more
					flexible zoning policies that support diverse housing types, such as apartments, accessory dwelling
					units (ADUs), and duplexes, to better serve the increasing number of single-person households.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/figure-8.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Finally, we turn to our third question. This map highlights the municipalities designated as MBTA
					Communities, distinguishing between those that fall under the policy (green) and those that do not
					(red). The majority of Metro Boston municipalities are classified as MBTA Communities, meaning they
					are subject to the requirements of the MBTA Communities Act to facilitate transit-oriented
					development. However, a few municipalities, such as <b>Boston, Bolton, Hudson, and Milford</b>, are
					marked in red,
					indicating that they are outside the scope of this policy. These areas may have fewer incentives or
					obligations to implement zoning changes that encourage multi-family housing near transit. The
					geographic distribution suggests that municipalities closer to <b>Boston</b> and along major transit
					corridors are better positioned to benefit from upzoning due to their existing transit connectivity.
					In contrast, more suburban and exurban areas that do not fall under the MBTA Communities Act may be
					less inclined, or even resistant, to adopting density-friendly zoning reforms. Given these patterns,
					I
					am curious whether average household size plays a role in shaping how these communities respond to
					transit-oriented development policies.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/figure-9.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This map visualizes the average household size across MBTA Communities, with lighter shades
					representing smaller household sizes and darker shades indicating larger ones. The variation in
					household size could have significant implications for housing demand and zoning policies,
					particularly in the context of transit-oriented development. Areas with larger household sizes, such
					as parts of <b>Wellesley</b> and <b>Quincy</b>, may require housing that accommodates
					multi-generational living or
					larger family units, while areas with smaller household sizes might benefit from an increase in
					smaller, multi-family housing options. The presence of smaller average household sizes in some MBTA
					Communities suggests that a diverse range of housing options, beyond traditional single-family
					homes, is needed to better align with the realities of household composition. Given these patterns,
					the next logical question is whether the percentage of single-family zoning in each municipality can
					indicate which communities are most likely to benefit from transit-oriented development and which
					might resist these changes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figures/figure-10.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					This map illustrates the percentage of land zoned exclusively for single-family housing in MBTA
					Communities, with darker shades indicating higher proportions of single-family zoning. We see
					that suburban municipalities, particularly in the western and southern regions, are
					heavily dominated by single-family zoning, while municipalities closer to Boston and along major
					transit corridors tend to have more mixed-use or multi-family zoning. The prevalence of
					single-family zoning in many MBTA Communities suggests that these areas may face significant
					challenges in complying with the <i>MBTA Communities Act</i>’s goal of promoting multi-family
					housing near
					transit. High single-family zoning could signal potential resistance to upzoning, as these
					municipalities may need to implement major zoning reforms to accommodate denser housing options.
					Conversely, areas with lower single-family zoning percentages are likely better positioned to adapt
					to transit-oriented development more seamlessly, benefiting from increased housing diversity and
					improved accessibility to public transit.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Through this exploratory visual analysis, I uncovered key insights into how zoning policies shape
				demographic, economic, and household composition patterns across Metro Boston municipalities. The
				municipalities with the highest proportion of single-family zoning tend to be predominantly White,
				high-income communities, reinforcing historical patterns of exclusion. Income distribution further
				highlights how these areas disproportionately benefit wealthier households, while lower-income residents
				face barriers to entry due to restrictive housing policies. Unlike race and income, gender distribution
				remains relatively balanced, but the age breakdown suggests that an aging population may contribute to
				single-family zoning by limiting housing opportunities for younger, more diverse residents. Examining
				household types revealed a clear mismatch in many municipalities—areas with a high percentage of
				nonfamily or single-person households often lack appropriate housing options due to rigid single-family
				zoning. Finally, exploring MBTA Communities underscored the varying degrees of readiness and resistance
				to transit-oriented development, with municipalities that have high single-family zoning percentages
				likely to face the greatest challenges in upzoning for multi-family housing. These findings emphasize
				the need for more flexible and inclusive zoning policies that better align with evolving housing demands
				and promote greater socioeconomic and racial diversity.</p>
